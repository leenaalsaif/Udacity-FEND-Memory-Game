# Udacity's Memory Game Project

## Game Description
After learning the fundamentals of Javascript programming, we were asked to create a mini browser game. In order to play the game, you need to flip the cards and match the tiles together in pairs. There are eight pairs in total that you need to match in order to win the game.

## How To Run The Game

After downloading the ZIP file containing all the game files and extracting it, double-click on index.html and open it in your browser.

## How To Play

Click on the grey boxes to flip the cards. If the cards you flipped match, then you will gain a point. Repeat until you match all the cards.
